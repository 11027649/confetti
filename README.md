What is Confetti?
=================

Confetti is a high-performance, easily-configurable particle system library that can animate any
set of objects through space. You can specify your starting conditions and physical conditions
(e.g. X and Y acceleration, boundaries, etc.), and let the confetti library take care of the rest.
